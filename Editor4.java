/**
 * Demonstrates the morphing into grayscaled version operation featured by Runigram.java. 
 * The program recieves two command-line arguments: a string representing the name
 * of the PPM file of a source image and the number of morphing steps (an int). 
 * For example, to morph the ironman into grayscaled ironman in 50 steps, use:
 * java Editor3 ironman.ppm 50
 * Note: There is no need to scale the target image to the size of the source
 * image, since Runigram.morph performs this action.
